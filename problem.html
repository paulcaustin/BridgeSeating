<title>The Chamberlain Bridge Problem Description</title>
<h1>The Bridge Problem Description</h1>
The original problem, as I remember it, was described by
my mother.  She liked to play bridge.  There are groups
of women that get together and play for small prizes.
Typically they have 24 people and they play 8 games of bridge.
They have some scoring convention to decide who wins but
that part isn't important in this discussion.
<p>
In bridge, four people sit at each table and play a game.
The people that sit across from each other are partners.
So there are two "teams" at each table.  It's not important
to the scoring about who plays with who or who plays
against who, but the ladies consider this to be really
a social event rather than a competition.  If some thought
isn't put into these seating arrangements the ladies will
complain that they end up playing the same people all the
time.
<p>
Our challenge then, simply enough, was to come up with a
seating chart for each of the eight games where everyone
gets to play a game with everyone else.
<p>
This turned out to be much more difficult than a quick
thought would lead you to believe.  Sitting down with a
pencil and a piece of paper and trying it turns out to
be an exercise in frustration.
<p>
The first week or so of searching for a solution consisted
of writing a program to go through each and every possible
seating arrangement and try to find a perfect arrangement.
I soon realized that this problem was quite large.  A friend
of mine, who was thrilled to be able to use mathematical
equations for a real world question, convinced me that there
could be no perfect arrangement.
<p>
The ladies were obviously not happy with the way some
bridge gatherings were run and I'm sure they weren't
really concerned with wether or not we could acheive
the perfect seating arrangement.  So we had to try for
something better than ladies trying to pick a seat or
even random seat assignments.
<h2>How to score an arrangement</h2>
The first step was to devise a way to compare seating
arrangements and decide which was better.  We have
come to agree on minimizing the number of times someone
plays with someone they have already played with.  That
is, if Elizabeth played with (or against) Janice in two
different games, it is tallied as one point, and you
should strive for a minimum number of points.  If they
play with (or against) each other in three different
games, it is tallied as two points.  I call each of
these points a "bad seating".
<p>
Note, in the above description, both Elizabeth and
Janice are displeased with their seats, but we still
count it as one point.  To calculate the score I really
build a <a href="scoring.html">rectangular table</a>
with the players listed
across the top and the players listed down the side.
An ideal solution would have nothing but 1's in it,
but that is impossible.  I get my score by examining
each value in the table.  If the value is greater
than one, than the score is equal to the number minus
one, otherwise it is zero.  Of course, the table is
symmetric about the diagonal, so I divide by two --
just for convention.
<p>
If you're really quick, you'll notice that a player
can play with three other players for each of the
eight games, which makes twenty-four players.  Since
there are only 23 other players, there will be at
least one player that he plays with twice.  For every
player that he does not play with, there will be one
additional time that he plays with somebody that he
has already played with.  So, the number of points
is also equal to twenty-four plus the number of
zeros in the table, then divide by two.
<h2>Fickle women, that wasn't good enough</h2>
For quite a while the ladies that my mother played with,
used one of the seating arrangements that I had designed.
But my mother mentioned that the bridge players didn't like
being "player 19" on the seating arrangement because that
player sits at the same table too much.  She also pointed
out that having the same partner twice was a major no-no.
<p>
Okay fine.  When a player sits at the same table more than
once, I now call it a "bad tabling".  When a player partners
with the same player more than once, I now call it a
"bad partnering".  I still don't know the relative badness
of the three bad things but I have tweaked my recent attempts
to at least not ignore these negative things when looking
for a good "score".
