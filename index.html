<title>The Chamberlain Bridge Problem</title>
<h1>The Chamberlain Bridge Problem</h1>
The men in my family love a good mental challenge and
one day, several years ago, my mother provided us with 
one that we still work on occasionally.  This was a
real world problem and the goal was to satisfy a bunch
of women that, at times, seemed to be very fickle.
<p>
It's important to remember that this challenge has
lasted many years.  We've learned new things.  We've
doubled our computing power a couple of times.  The
women have added new complications to the problem.

The goal was to come up with

for a 6-table 8-game bridge tournament.
