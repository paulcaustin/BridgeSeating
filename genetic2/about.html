<title>Improved Genetic Algorithms with The Chamberlain Bridge Problem</title>
<h1>Using Improved Genetic Algorithms</h1>
Put simply, a
<a href="http://www.yahoo.com/Science/Computer_Science/Algorithms/Genetic_Algorithms/">
Genetic Algorithm</a> creates random "creatures", sorts
them by most likely to survive and then creates mutations and
combinations of the existing creatures to create new ones.
The most successful are used (as in natural selection) in the
mutations and the least successful die.
<p>
After many iterations of tweaking the algorithm and restarting
with a new set of random creatures I came up with a great idea.
<p>
<h2>I don't need to start with random creatures.</h2>
I should be able
to seed the population with already proven creatures and let
mutation and natural selection do its thing.
<p>
I created <a href="./">an improved version of my program</a>
and <strong>it works great!</strong>
I took the original setup, the 32 setup, and the 31 setup,
made a few creatures of each type and started it.  It refined
it a little bit and quit.  I added the refined one to the
list of initial creatures, tweaked some options and ran again.
After running quite a few times I came up with a setup
that has <a href="results.html">28 bad seatings</a>,
no bad partnerings, and just a few
bad tablings!  A <strong>huge</strong> improvement over the original setup.
<p>
What's really slick is that I don't need to know which creatures
are prime evolutionary candidates.  I just throw them all in
together and let
<a href="http://www.xmission.com/~gastown/dorrell/darwin.htm">
Darwinism</a> do it's trick.  It's like trying to
get an ocean full of algea to mutate into a super-human but
spiking the algea with a few humans and other animals to give
it a head start.
