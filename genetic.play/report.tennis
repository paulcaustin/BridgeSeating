Okay, I've got you a "movement", as the bridge players call it.
Because I have put quite a bit of time into the program that
does this, I require that you give me credit any time you
use this movement, even though you'll probably make it look
much prettier.  Put this somewhere on it:

Your particular problem turned out to not be very difficult
for the computer to solve (although I understand how tough
it can be to do it with pen and paper, I've tried).  What I
do is I assign a letter to each player.  In your case, I also
had to assign numbers since you went over 26.  Male players
would be A, C, E, G, etc., and female players would be B, D,
F, H, etc.  Each line represents one "round" and each grouping
represents one "court".

    KDH5 XOTU M4C2 LGQF NSWB ZIAJ P36Y R1VE
    L1MZ J3RW APTK 25NE I4SF OD6Q XGCV BUHY

This means that player V (female) and player 3 (male) are
partners playing against player 2 (female) and player Q
(male) the first round and on the first court.  And so on...

Now I didn't check every single one of the partnerships
to make sure they're always male/female, but I did do
a spot check.  Below is some analysis that my program does.
Since the program easily met your requirements it also tried
to keep people from playing on the same court all the time.

I hope you have fun this weekend, and I hope that your
participants enjoy how well the movement works out.
