<title>Using Genetic Algorithms on The Chamberlain Bridge Problem</title>
<h1>Using Genetic Algorithms</h1>
Put simply, a
<a href="http://www.yahoo.com/Science/Computer_Science/Algorithms/Genetic_Algorithms/">
Genetic Algorithm</a> creates "creatures", sorts
them by most likely to survive and then creates mutations and
combinations of the existing creatures to create new ones.
The most successful are used (as in natural selection) in the
mutations and the least successful die.
<p>
In <a href="./">my program</a>, a creature is an 8-game 6-table setup.  A
combination of two creatures uses a few games from each setup.
A mutation swaps two seating positions within a game.  These
definitions were arrived at with almost no thought but upon
running it, I came up with a solution which had
<a href="results.html">31 bad seatings</a>
in about one day!  This was incredible but it was difficult to
reproduce, difficult to improve on, and not much better than 33.
<p>
While braggin to my mom about these amazing results,
she mentioned that the bridge players didn't like being
"player 19" on the current seating arrangement because he
sits at the same table too much.  She also pointed out that
having the same partner twice was a major no-no.
<p>
The solutions that I had created with my Genetic Algorithm
scored 31 and 32 but were pretty bad in terms of bad partnerings
and what I have come to call "bad tablings" -- repeatedly sitting
at the same table.
<p>
To try to eliminate these problems,
I modified my scoring algorithm to score 5 points for the
bad seating, 10 for bad partnering, and 2 for bad tabling.
<p>
Starting with completely random creatures, and continuously
mutating through several million generations I have not yet
been able to do significantly better than the setup with 33
bad seatings.
<p>
After many iterations of tweaking the algorithm and restarting
with a new set of random creatures I came up with a great idea.
I could <a href="../genetic2/about.html">spike the soup</a>.
