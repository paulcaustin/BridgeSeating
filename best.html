<title>Best seating chart for 6-table 8-game bridge tournament</title>
<h1>My best seating chart</h1>
This is a seating chart for a 6-table 8-game bridge tournament.
I have worked very hard on this seating chart.  If you decide to make
use of it, please <a href="mailto:tif@pobox.com">send me some mail</a>.
Please don't claim that it is yours, and if you duplicate it (either
electronically or on paper), please include my Copyright.  I don't want
to prevent anybody from using it for whatever, I'd just like to have
proper credit for my efforts:

<p>
I have created a
<a href=out.html>full set of preformatted printouts</a> for the
bridge ladies.  They have very specific requirements for their
score sheet.  These should
come out looking fine with Netscape.  You might want to go to "Print Setup"
and disable the headers and footers.

<p>
<h2>Details on the seating chart</h2>
After running my <a href="genetic2/about.html">
improved genetic algorithm</a>
for about 10 days.  I came up with this
setup.  I have reason to believe that there
is no better.  If something here doesn't make
sense to you, you should probably read my
description of <a href=problem.html>the problem</a>.
<p>
Each player is represented by a letter from A to X.
Each group of four letters represents the players
that are seated at a table for a single game.
Each line represents a game.  For example, for the
first game, players A and B play against players
W and S at table one.
